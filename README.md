# Predicting MLB Offensive Value Using Regression

This project uses historical MLB player data to identify the most predictive statistics for evaluating offensive performance. The goal was to build a regression model that estimates a player's offensive contribution and isolate key drivers of value.

## Tools Used
- R
- Regression Modeling
- MLB Statcast / Baseball Reference Data

## Key Methods
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Feature Selection & Comparison
- Residual Analysis

## Findings
- ISO (Isolated Power) emerged as the single most predictive variable of offensive value.
- Secondary contributors included OBP and SLG, though multicollinearity required careful interpretation.
- The model provided insight into which advanced stats should be weighted more heavily in player evaluation.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates regression modeling skills applied to a rich, multi-variable sports dataset. Findings offer practical implications for player scouting, roster optimization, and fantasy baseball analytics.
